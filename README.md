# Video Preview

### Objectives

- Practice using onmouseover and onmouseout
- Practice working from an existing code base
For this assignment we'll be working with some existing code you can find in the next link, so you do need to create your own code (download here) to add a video in. We'll want to find a free video that we want to work with from https://www.pexels.com/videos/. Pexels.com is a website where you can download images/videos for free with the right to use use them for personal or business use. Next, 
we'll want to add the video into a video tag in the HTML. To make the website more interactive add hover events to play and pause the video when hovering.

# Hints:

We may need to make use of the .play() and .pause() methods - reference (on this link, you can find more references about this lesson topic).

We may also need the video to be muted as modern browsers want users to interact with (click) videos for them to start playing.
